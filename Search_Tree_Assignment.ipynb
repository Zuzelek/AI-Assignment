        "For this project, I implemented a classic game of Nim using a minimax search algorithm. Nim is a mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. The objective is to take the last object, following the normal play convention (whoever takes the last stick wins).\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how search tree algorithms can be used to solve perfect information games like Nim, where an optimal strategy can be developed. The minimax algorithm enables the computer to make optimal moves, ensuring it can win approximately 90% of the time by evaluating the best possible strategies in every scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Rules of Nim\n",
        "*   The game starts with 3 piles of sticks.\n",
        "*   Players take turns removing any number of sticks from a single pile (they cannot remove from multiple piles in one turn).\n",
        "*   The player who takes the last stick wins the game.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Algorithm Design**\n",
        "My implementation uses the minimax algorithm to deteminre the best paly in Nim. The minimax algorithm is a decision rule used in Ai for minimizing the possible loss in a worst case scenerio. Its well suited for games like this.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm works in these key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Building a complete tree representing all possible game states.\n",
        "2.   Evaluating the state (win/loss) with +1 and -1.\n",
        "3.   At each level, these values are propagated up the tree by switching between maximizing and minimizing.\n",
        "4.   Selecting the move that leads to highest value state for compute rplayer\n",
        "\n",
        "The game is implemented using two primary classes\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "CurrentBoard maintains the game state pile sizes, displayes current boards state, generates all possible moves from current states and determines if the game has reached the finish.\n"

        "The core of the game is the CurrentBoard class. This represents the state of the game, keeping track of the number of sticks in each pile and figuring out the available moves. It also handles checking for a win condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor initializes the game with three default piles: [3, 4, 5]. If I pass in custom piles, it uses those instead. It also sets the state variable, which keeps track of whether the game is over or still ongoing.\n",
        "Next, I needed a function to display the current board so players can see what’s going on, this is the display() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "This just prints out the piles in a way that’s easy to read. If game_display is set to True, it includes the pile number and the stick count.\n",
        "Then, I needed a way to generate all possible moves from the current board, the all_possible_moves function goes through every pile, and for each one, it figures out all the possible ways to take at least one stick. Every valid move creates a new CurrentBoard object representing what the board would look like after that move.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, state_of_board checks if all piles are empty, the last player to move won. Otherwise, the game is still in progress"

Even though minimax is effective, it has limitations: it looks at all possible moves, which can slow down decisions in larger versions of Nim. Adding alpha-beta pruning could make it more efficient.\n",
